# Here Before It Goes Viral

Here Before It Goes Viral is an interactive web-based pandemic simulation tool designed to model infection spread in a city. It allows users to visualize the impact of public health measures (such as mask mandates, school closures, and lockdowns) on infection rates, using real-time statistical updates and graphical representations.

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Simulation**: Models the spread of infections in a city environment, tracking susceptible, infected, and recovered populations over time.
- **Customizable Geographic Bounds**: Users can define city layouts and geographic boundaries for the simulation.
- **Public Health Protocols**: Simulates the effects of public health measures like mask mandates, school closures, and lockdowns on infection dynamics.
- **Dynamic Data Visualization**: Uses Google Maps to dynamically visualize city layouts and population movements.
- **SIR Model Implementation**: Accurately follows the SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) model using probabilistic individual decisions.

## Technical Concepts
1. **Full-Stack Development**: Built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for the frontend, with Python and FastAPI handling the backend processing.
2. **FastAPI**: Enables efficient communication between the frontend and backend, processing complex simulations and real-time data.
3. **Google Maps API**: Used for dynamically visualizing city layouts and simulating population movements in customizable geographic areas.
4. **SIR Epidemiological Model**: Models the infection spread using predefined city dynamics and infection parameters.
5. **Real-Time Data & Visualization**: Provides real-time statistical updates and visual representations of the simulation results.
